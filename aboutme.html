	<p>Hi my name is Jiyong Park and I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and originally from Korea.
	I was typically interested in mathematics and sciences in high school, which led me to consider Computer Science as my major. I lived in Vienna, Austria for around 6 years. 
	I have travelled to many different cities and countries. Academically, I challenged myself both in school and outside of school. I am just a normal student, trying to be the best at my field by working 
	to my best efforts.
	</p>
	
	<p>While at UIUC, I am interested in joining ACM Gamebuilders (an ACM special interest group for game development), and Technology team in Korean Student Association (KSA).
	I am currently a part of Web development in Korean Engineers and Scientist Society (KESS). </p>
